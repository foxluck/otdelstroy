By adding tags to products you will allow your customers to quickly select only products associated to a specific word (tag). E.g., you may assign a tag matching the manufacturer's name to several products and add a tag cloud to the storefront layout. Tags are displayed in the storefront as simple links. A click on a link displays the list of products to which the corresponding tag has been assigned. Thus, alternative navigation through product catalog by manufacturer (for instance) can be implemented in addition to the basic navigation by category. Individual tags must be separated by a comma from each other.</p><p><strong>Page title</strong>: this value is added to the value of the TITLE tag of the product page in the storefront. If you leave this field empty, the product name and online store name will be added to the TITLE tag.</p><p><strong>Keywords</strong>: enter the keywords which should be added to the contents of the META tag <em>keywords</em> on the product page. Maximum allowed length is 255 characters.</p><p><strong>Description</strong>: enter the text which should be added to the contents of the META 
tag <em>description</em> on the product page. Maximum allowed length is 255 
characters.</p><p><strong>Product images</strong>: this section of the product-adding page allows you to upload image files with photos or pictures of your products. To upload a file from your computer, select the first option and select the file.&nbsp; You may also upload an image file located on any website (without password protection). To do so, select the second option and paste the URL of such an image file to the text field. After you have selected a file from your computer or have pasted its URL, click &quot;Upload&quot; to actually upload the file to the server. When an image file is uploaded, its reduced versions are automatically generated and saved. Reduced versions of a product image are used on the product page (default image) and on category listing pages or search-results pages (thumbnail). Original image is displayed when a store visitor clicks a default image on the product page in the storefront. The dimensions of <em>default product images</em> and <em>thumbnails</em> are specified in settings section &quot;<strong>Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>Products</strong>&quot;.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Important</strong>: Avoid uploading image files if their names contain characters of national alphabets (except for English) or special characters. Such characters may be incorrectly processed by some web browsers of web servers/services.<br /></p></blockquote><p>To enter extended product parameters, open the &quot;Other details&quot; tab on the product-adding page:</p><p><img src="images/Snap8.gif" />&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Product code (SKU)</strong>: enter a unique identifier of the product (<em>stock-keeping unit</em>) of the product. Using a product code may be useful during bulk import of product data from a CSV file and for better accounting of your sales.</p><p><strong>Page ID (part of page URL; utilized in links to product page)</strong>: if SEO-friendly URLs are enabled in your store, this value will be added to the URLs of product pages in the storefront. If left empty, the page ID will be automatically generated from the product name. Avoid using the same page ID for several products as this will make only one of such products available to customers.</p><p><strong>Invisible</strong>: enabling this option will temporarily hide the product from customers. The product actually remains in the catalog and only visually disappears from the storefront.</p><p><strong>Available for ordering</strong>:<strong> </strong>if this option is enabled, the &quot;Add to cart&quot; button appears next to the product name in the storefront. Otherwise the product is not available for ordering, but its description and photos (if uploaded) remain visible to customers.</p><p><strong>Tax type</strong>: select the tax which should be applied to the product base price during checkout. Tax rates are defined in section &quot;<strong>Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>Taxes</strong>&quot;.</p><p><strong>Regular price</strong>: specify any numeric value which will be displayed as a &quot;discounted&quot; price in the storefront to inform customers that you are currently selling this product at a lower price. Next to the discounted price customers will also see how much they will save if they purchase the product at the current price. The <em>regular price</em> must be higher than the base price, otherwise it will not be shown to customers. Note that the <em>regular price</em> is used for informational (advertising) purposes only and is not involved in the calculation of order total during checkout.</p><p><strong>Handling charge</strong>: extra cost per ordered product, which is automatically added to the total shipping charge. The handling charge is multiplied by the number of product items ordered and is applied only to the products in whose properties handling charge is specified (is different from zero). Handling charge is applied regardless of whether the <em>Free shipping toggle</em> option is enabled.</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: the weight of a product is specified in weight units selected in section &quot;<strong>Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>Products</strong>&quot;. It is mainly used for calculation of shipping charges.</p><p><strong>Free shipping</strong>: enabling this option will disable the shipping cost calculation step for this product during checkout. This setting does not affect the <em>handling charge</em> which is always added to the shipping cost of an order.</p><p><strong>Minimum order quantity</strong>: specifying any integer value above zero will not allow customers to order a lower number of items of this product. Should a customer attempt to order a lesser number of such products, a warning will appear in the storefront, and further checkout will be disabled until the required minimum number of products is added to the shopping cart. Enter <em>0</em> to disable this limitation.</p><p><strong>Sort order</strong>: this setting accepts positive and negative integer values to set the position of a product in the storefront. The lower the value, the higher is the product's position in the category.</p><p><strong>See also</strong>: you may select an unlimited number of related products which you would like to offer to customers. The names and thumbnails of related products' images are displayed on the product page in the storefront. Customers can click on their names, read their descriptions, and order them together with the main product.</p><p><strong>Product extra categories</strong>: in addition to the main parent category, a product can also appear in other categories in the storefront. To achieve that, add extra parent categories in this section: click &quot;Add&quot; and select the desired categories in the pop-up window.</p><p><strong>This product is downloadable</strong>: if the product is a file (audio, video, software, etc.), you may provide a link to a customer for downloading instead of sending it on a physical media (CD or DVD). To deliver purchased electronic products online, enable this option in product properties and select the file from your computer. Then specify the period during which the purchased file should remain available to customer and enter the maximum number of download attempts. <strong>Important</strong>: Avoid uploading image files if their names contain characters of national alphabets (except for English) or special characters. Such characters may be incorrectly processed by some web browsers of web servers/services.<br /></p><p>In addition to the basic product parameters listed above, you may assign an unlimited number of custom properties to a product. To do so, open the &quot;Custom product parameters&quot; tab on the product-adding page:</p><p><img src="images/Snap9.gif" /></p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Prior to specifying values for custom product parameters, necessary parameters must first be created in section &quot;<strong>Products</strong> -&gt; <strong>Product parameters</strong>&quot;.</p></blockquote><p>This tab contains the list of all available custom parameters. To enter a fixed text value for a parameter, select the &quot;<em>Custom value (text)</em>&quot; option for that parameter and enter the desired value. To specify several selectable values for a parameter, select the corresponding (third) option, click &quot;<em>Select available choices...</em>&quot; and make your choices in the pop-up window.</p><p>Note that any of the predefined values can be chosen as the default one. The default option will be automatically selected in the storefront. Yet, customer will still be able to select other options from a drop-down list. Each option can be selected twice. It means that the same product property with a drop-down list will appear twice in the store front and customer will be able to select several different (or equal) values of such properties. And last, each parameter value can be assigned a surplus value, which will be added to the product price, if the corresponding value is selected by customer. E.g., you may need that selection of a certain product size adds a certain amount to its base price. Create custom parameter &quot;Size&quot; with selectable options &quot;S&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;XL&quot;, etc., and specify the desired surplus values for each size on the product-adding or editing page.<br /></p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: bulk product import using a CSV file <strong>will not automatically resize</strong> product images. To ensure that reduced images versions appear in your storefront, create them manually using any suitable image editor (e.g., GIMP or Adobe Photoshop) and upload them to the server using administrative section &quot;Design -&gt; Image Uploader&quot; or via FTP into directory <em>published/publicdata/DATABASE_KEY/attachments/SC/products_pictures/</em>. Once that is done, specify the names of image files delimited by a comma in appropriate cells of the CSV file as shown in the table above, and import the file.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you do not need to import all product properties, you may include only the desired columns in the CSV file (e.g., descriptions) and the <em>required columns</em> listed below:</p><ol><li>&quot;Price&quot;</li><li>The column which you are planning to select as the primary column during import; i.e., &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Product code (SKU)&quot;, or &quot;Page ID (part of page URL; utilized in links to product page)&quot;.<br /></li></ol></blockquote>

<p><strong>Catalog structure</strong><br /></p><p>All product names listed in the cells of a CSV file, must be grouped by categories. Before each product group there must be the name of the appropriate category. Names of top-level categories are specified without special markers. If a category is nested inside another category, an exclamation mark <em>(!)</em> must precede its name<em></em>. The category nesting level is unlimited.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: the <em>Name</em> and <em>Price</em> columns in a CSV file may look as shown in the example below:</p>

<p>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" class="csv-details"><tbody><tr><td width="347"><em>Name</em></td><td width="347"><em>Price</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Category 1</strong><br /></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Product 1 of category 1<br /></td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Product 2 of category 1</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td><strong>!Subcategory 1 of category 1</strong><br /></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Product 1 of subcategory 1<br /></td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td><strong>!!Subcategory 1 of subcategory 1</strong><br /></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Category 2</strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Product 1 of category 2</td><td>65</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p>
<p>Importing a file containing (among others) such columns will create the following catalog structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Category 1</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Product 1 of category 1</li>
    <li>Product 2 of category 1</li>

<p>After creation of a CSV file open section &quot;Products -&gt; Import&quot;. Select the file from your computer, the data separator used in your CSV file (usually a semicolon), and the file encoding (often <em>iso-8859-1</em> or <em>utf-8</em>), and click &quot;OK&quot;. The next page will display the number of columns detected in the uploaded CSV file. Use the table at the page bottom to choose which columns of the CSV file should be imported into which products database fields. If you decide not to import some product property (e.g., &quot;Pictures&quot;), select &quot;<em>ignore this column</em>&quot;.</p><p>In the &quot;<em>Primary column</em>&quot; select the product property uniquely identifying each product. This choice depends on the way you distinguish products in your catalog: by <em>product code (SKU)</em>, by <em>name</em>, or by the <em>page ID</em>. If during import an existing product is detected in the catalog with a value of the unique identifier exactly matching the same value of a product property in the CSV file, then the product properties from the CSV file (for which you have not selected the &quot;ignore this column&quot; option) will overwrite the properties of the existing product in the catalog.</p><p>For instance, if you have selected the product code (SKU) as the primary column and there is a product with the SKU <em>dr156</em> in the catalog, and you are importing a CSV file containing information about a product with the same SKU (<em>dr156</em>), then information about that product from the CSV file will overwrite the properties of the existing product.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: The range of search for products with matching values of the primary column can be adjusted by use of the <em>&quot;When searching for products in the database by primary column, search only within current product category</em>&quot; option at the page top. With that option enabled, the search will be performed only within the category, which is specified as the parent category for that product in the CSV file (if such a category exists in the online catalog). Products with matching values of the primary column residing in other categories are not taken into account in this case. If that option is disabled, such products are searched in the entire catalog.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you need to have products with equal values of a certain primary column (e.g., names) in different categories, you should enable the &quot;<em>When searching for products in the database by primary column, search only within current product category</em>&quot; option during import. Otherwise, if values of a primary column (e.g., SKU) should be unique for all products in the catalog, that option must be disabled during import</p></blockquote></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td height=0><a name="product-lists"></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="98%"><tr><td><h3>Product lists</h3><p>Any group of products can be presented in the storefront separately from the common catalog for advertising or other similar purposes.

Shipping methods available to customers are configured in section &quot;<strong>Settings</strong> –&gt; <strong>Shipping</strong>&quot; section. To change the order in which they appear in storefront, drag and drop the shipping methods names using your mouse cursor.</p>
<p>To add a new shipping method, click the &quot;Add shipping method&quot; button. On the next page select the module, which will calculate the shipping charge, from the following options:<br /></p>

<p><strong>No shipping rate calculation</strong>: this method does not add any cost to the order total.</p>
<p><strong>DHL, FedEx, InterShipper, UPS, USPS</strong>: these methods allow you to use real shipping quote calculations provided by third-party services. To use these modules, you need to register an account with the appropriate provider and receive your personal credentials, which must be saved in the shipping module settings.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: The above listed providers offer their services mostly for continental US locations and their service availability for other locations has to be checked individually.</p></blockquote>
<p>When a customer selects one of the above shipping options, the store automatically sends a request with your origination address, customer's location, order total weight, and chosen shipping options to the provider's server. The shipping charge received from the server is added to the order total. With some of these online shipping services a customer may choose the delivery and packaging type.</p><p>The following methods are purely algorithmic and calculations are done according to their settings.</p>
<p><strong>By countries/states module (fixed rates) </strong>and <strong>By countries/states module (percent of order amount) </strong>allow you to set shipping cost for each country and its regions as a fixed amount (expressed in the default currency) or a percentage of the order total.</p>
<p><strong>Ground shipping </strong>and <strong>Ground shipping (by weight) </strong>allow you to set shipping cost according to the customer's postal address. It can be specified as a fixed amount or be calculated according to the total weight of the order. Every country and region can have a separate cost calculation schedule assigned. Four methods described above will be offered only to customers for whose countries/regions they have been set up.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum of a fixed shipping rate and percent of order total</strong>: this module calculates the greater of the two values (the fixed amount specified in the module settings and a percentage of the order total) and adds the result to the order shipping charge.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed shipping rate + percent</strong>:&nbsp; the algorithm of this module is similar to the one described above with the exception that both values are summed and then applied to the order shipping charge.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td height=0><a name="Order-processing"></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="98%"><tr><td><h2>Order processing</h2><p><strong>New order notifications</strong></p><p>When a new order is placed by a customer, the store administrator receives an automatically sent notification by email or also by SMS (if SMS notifications have been set up in section &quot;<strong>Orders</strong> -&gt; <strong>SMS</strong>&quot;).

<p>Attract new customers by offering a commission to your existing clients that bring in new ones. Affiliate program settings can be accessed in Customers-&gt;Affiliate program section. First you have to enable it. Registered customers will see info on participating in their account details at the storefront upon login.</p>
<p>For the sale to be accounted towards commission for the affiliate partner one of the two conditions should be fulfilled. New referred customer either specify affiliate's login during checkout, or comes into your store via specially created link with the affiliate's ID in it. ID can be looked up in My account section of the main menu of the store front available to registered customers.</p>
<p>For example affiliate partner is registered with the &quot;partner&quot; login and goes to check his My account section of the storefront. Depending on whether Friendly URLs are turned on he will see one of the two links: http://your-store.com/referral/5/ or http://your-store.com/shop/index.php?refid=5. He can publish this link as it is on his own website, mail it to his friends or post it in the blog. As a result, any purchase made by a visitor that came using this link will be accounted towards commissions for the affiliate partner. Links can be made not only to the home page, but to any product or category page as well. For example, a link to some category in your store looks like http://your-store.com/category/some/. If you add referral/5/ to it where 5 is the partner's id it will have same result as in the above automatically generated link description. If friendly URLs are off, then you category link will look like http://your-store.com/shop/index.php?categoryID=556 and making it an affiliate referral link requires extra ?refid=5 at the end of it. Same is true regarding individual product pages.</p>
<p>If referred customer came through such link and registered, all of his future purchases will also be considered as a source of commission for the affiliate. It will be so until store administrator deletes this relationship by editing affiliates account info in Affiliate program tab accessible in Customers-&gt;Customers-&gt;Affiliate's customer record. Same tab can be accessed in Affiliate program section of the administration by clicking on the affiliates login in a list generated upon commission calculation.</p>
<p>Commissions are calculated per administrator's request. In Customers-&gt;Affiliate program section administrator needs to specify rate, set affiliates notification options. Beneath them you need to specify date range and click View button to check database for commissionable sales within it. After that you will see a list of affiliates with the amounts they are owed. You can edit amount calculated and currency or completely delete certain calculations. If necessary, commissions can be added manually by filling respective fields below the list.</p>
<p>Once commissions are calculated, you need to pay them out by generating notification to affiliates and specifying amounts within calculated limits. Resulting balance (commissions less payments for the period) is shown as balance outstanding. It can be both positive (store owes to an affiliate partner) and negative (when partner was overpaid).</p>
<p>One of the convenient ways to process payouts is to create one time use discount coupons for you affiliates in the amount owed to them.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td height=0><a name="News-letter-subscribers"></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="98%"><tr><td><h3>Newsletter subscribers</h3>

Little snippets of embeddable HTML code that can be built into any web page and present some useful information from another source are called widgets. WebAsyst Shop-Script has three types of them. With their help you can place &quot;live&quot; information about your products and store practically anywhere on the Internet. Widgets placed on other web pages will work only if you have functional store they were created in..
</p><p><strong>&quot;Product info&quot; widget</strong> shows particular product information (name, description, price, picture) and Add to cart button that allows its ordering.</p>
<p>If you already have product information on a widget target page, and there is no need to duplicate it, use <strong>&quot;Add to cart&quot; widget</strong> instead. Place it near product info and you site/blog/page visitors will be able to order product without visiting your storefront.</p>
<p>In some cases, when you already have popular, well indexed site and plan to enhance it with a shopping cart functionality, in addition to the above described widgets, use <strong>&quot;View cart / Checkout&quot; widget.</strong> It will display visitors cart state. Independent use of this widget has no meaning, as it does not provide any ordering capabilities, only checkout of the already filled cart. </p>
<p>Widgets are created in administrative backend <strong>Tools –&gt; Widgets</strong> section. All three types are available in one place. To create Add to cart and Product info widgets, you need to look up product they will be linked to first. Enter part of the product name to perform search and click Find a product button. Search results will be shown as a list. Click on the product needed to see its widget HTML code. Copy code and paste it into the target page HTML source code. Save it and check result in a browser.</p>
<p>Widgets can be adjusted for use along with the Affiliate program. This will require manual editing of the link included in widget and adding affiliate's id into it. </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Current version of WebAsyst Shop-Script widgets may work incorrectly with products that have selectable extra parameters. In some cases, widgets do not transfer selected options correctly.

Her you set up additional interface languages for your store. Initially, English is set as default language. You can change this setting after translating to a new language. New visitors will see your store in a language set as default. Language settings can be changed by clicking <strong><span class="ssylko"><u>Settings</u></span></strong> link. Here you can set its two-letter ISO code, upload flag images, or disable it.
</p><p>A link <strong><span class="ssylko"><u>Edit translations</u></span></strong>,
opens a list of text messages used throughout the store. They can be changed for the existing language or translated for a newly added one. Messages are grouped by store's sections. Choose necessary by clicking on its tab and selecting a subsection from a drop down list.  Major tabs are <span class="zakladka">
General</span>, <span class="zakladka">
Frontend</span>, <span class="zakladka">
Backend</span>.</p>
<p>When new language is added, all of its message values are copied from the default language, and need to be translated.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip</strong>: with a new language added, do not forget to upload a new &quot;Add to cart&quot; button image for that language. Create an image file with the required picture and title using any suitable image editor (e.g., GIMP or Photoshop) and save it on your computer with a name of the form <em>add2cart_<strong>LANGUAGE_ID</strong>.gif</em>, where the newly added language ID should be specified instead of LANGUAGE_ID. For instance, if you have added German language with the ID <em>de</em>, then the file must be named <em>add2cart_de.gif</em>. Upload the image file to the server using administration section &quot;Design -&gt; Image Uploader&quot; under the &quot;Misc Images&quot; tab.</p></blockquote>
<p>Be careful when editing messages and do not delete any without necessity. If you want some of the messages to be omitted, you can delete their text values, not the constants themselves.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td height=0><a name="Image-uploader"></a></td></tr><tr><td align=center><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="98%"><tr><td><h3>Image uploader</h3>
