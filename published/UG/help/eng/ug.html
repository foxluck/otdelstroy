Exact meanings of these values are described in the user manuals for each WebAsyst service.</p><p>When selecting access level the following rule should be always taken into account: if group access level is different from that of the user's access, then the highest of these values will apply.</p><p>For example, if group access level is &quot;Read&quot;, and the &quot;Personal&quot; column for the same item contains &quot;Full&quot;, then the resulting access rights for this item will be &quot;Full&quot;.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Be careful when changing access rights — selected values are applied immediately.
