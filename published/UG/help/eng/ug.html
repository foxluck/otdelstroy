Once all necessary groups have been selected, click &quot;Save&quot;.</p><p><u>Access rights</u></p><p>This section allows you to set up personal access rights for the user. Setting up personal access rights is most efficient when combined with group access rights. A group is granted privileges which should be common for all its members, and each user's personal access settings should contain individual values not available in group access rights.</p><p>Information on the access setup page is displayed as a table of the following structure:</p><ul><li>first column contains the names of WebAsyst services and their separate sections;</li><li>second column contains setup tools for editing personal access rights of the user to WebAsyst services;</li><li>third column contains group access values which depend on the access settings of all groups in which this user is included.</li></ul><p>In order to change the user's access level to a certain WebAsyst service, select the desired value from the drop-down list across the name of the service:</p><ul><li>&quot;<strong>administrator</strong>&quot;: selecting this option will grant unlimited access to the corresponding WebAsyst service;</li><li>&quot;<strong>custom</strong>&quot;: selecting this option will add more rows to the table under the current row, where you can configure user's access to separate functions and sections of this WebAsyst service;</li><li>&quot;<strong>no access</strong>&quot;: selecting this option will disable user's access to the corresponding WebAsyst service.</li></ul><p>When changing access level to separate elements of a WebAsyst service (folders, albums, projects, books) you may specify several access level values: &quot;Read&quot;, &quot;Write&quot;, and &quot;Full&quot;. Exact meanings of these values are described in the user manuals for each WebAsyst service.</p><p>When selecting access level the following rule should be always taken into account: if group access level is different from that of the user's access, then the highest of these values will apply.</p><p>For example, if group access level is &quot;Read&quot;, and the &quot;Personal&quot; column for the same item contains &quot;Full&quot;, then the resulting access rights for this item will be &quot;Full&quot;.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Be careful when changing access rights â€” selected values are applied immediately.
